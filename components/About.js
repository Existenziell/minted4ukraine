      <h2>What's the current situation in Ukraine, why we started this project and how we can help.</h2>
      <ul className="md:grid md:grid-cols-2 gap-6">
        <li>On February 24th of this year, Putin authorized “special military operations” in Ukraine. The week that has followed has proven one of the hardest for Ukrainians and the world involved. It is now reported that nearly 900,000 Ukrainians have fled their homes and sought refuge in neighboring countries, like Poland. As of today the death toll, per the Ukraine Health Ministry, is said to be near 350 civilians, including 14 children; additionally, nearly 1700 civilians are reported as wounded, 116 children. (Aljazeera)</li>
        <li>These numbers are real and terrifying, Western Alliances have made sanctions towards Russia&apos;s central bank and taken other economic strides to try and deafen the tyranny of Putin and Russia&apos;s military but innocent Ukrainians are fleeing their home or being killed. Co-workers and Friends of Minted4Ukraine that are unfortunately caught in the bloodshed have shared their testimonials of the horrors they are enduring and it is abhorrent.</li>
        <li>We have heard of our friends and development team being turned away from the ATMs due to everyone being forced to take their savings out, lines for gas and food that never end, and literally bombs being dropped above them waking them up. The geopolitical tensions that have unfolded and resulted in this terrible situation can only begin having reparations starting with us.</li>
        <li>Mineted4Ukraine has partnered with the Red Cross of Ukraine, CARE, and Chabad to launch an NFT project, donating 100% of proceeds to the people of Ukraine. Our earnings will go towards those both in Ukraine and those who migrated to Host countries.</li>
