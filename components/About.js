      <h2>What's the current situation in Ukraine, why we started the project, how we are helping the situation</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>On February 24, 2022, Russia launched a full-scale military invasion into Ukraine. Fighting has caused over one hundred civilian casualties and pushed hundreds of thousands of Ukrainians to flee to neighboring countriesâ€”including Poland, Hungary, Moldova, Slovakia, Romania, and other European nations.</li>
        <li>Families have been waiting for up to 60 hours to cross at border points into Poland, in freezing weather, in queues up to 15km (10 miles) long.</li>
        <li>The UN estimates there are now at least 160,000 people in Ukraine who have fled the war and are displaced within their own country. The EU believes that figure could climb to seven million, and that 18 million Ukrainians will be affected by the war.</li>
        <li>These people need help.</li>
        <li>Minted4Ukraine aims to help these people by giving 100% of the proceeds of this NFT sale to humanitarian efforts for Ukranians both inside Ukraine and in host countries.</li>
        <li>We have partnered with the Red Cross of Ukraine, CARE, and Chabbad to ensure these funds are distributed immediately and directly to those most affected by this war.</li>
        <li>After waking up to all the news and phone calls from our friends and development teams in Ukraine we were in disbelief to hear about what was happening to our friends and co-workers. Over time we have gotten to know the peaceful, kindhearted, and hardworking people they are and couldnt even imagine what it is like for them to be woken up by the noise of bombs, the smell and sight of burning bulings, and much more. They told us how everybody went to the atms to try and pull out money and because of this the banks closed making it hard to get food and water and how lines at the gas station seemed to be formed for miles because people were trying to get gas and evacuate. After listening to our friends and coworkers speak our hearts were aching from all the pain that has been inflicted due to this crisis and we decided we needed to do something to help with the current crisis.</li>
        <li>We came up with the idea to launch an NFT project where 100% of the funds raised would go to different non-profits that we partner with who are actually making a difference and helping the people in Ukraine.</li>
